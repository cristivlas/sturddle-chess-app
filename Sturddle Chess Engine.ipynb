    "# Sturddle: A Chess Engine and Application\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Sturddle is developed as a tool to explore and learn from the fields of Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI) and modern AI. The project uses chess, a domain with rich resources such as extensive literature, numerous existing engine implementations, and a vast array of training data, making it an effective medium for studying AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Composition\n",
    "The engine is a blend of C++, Cython, and Python, integrating various search algorithms including MTD(f), Negascout, and Negamax, with MTD(f) as the default choice for its balance of efficiency and search depth. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTD(f)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evolution of Evaluation Methods in Chess Engines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Evaluation and the Integration of NNUE in Stockfish\n",
    "- **Traditional Methods**: Chess engines like Stockfish traditionally used heuristics including material balance, pawn structure, piece activity, and king safety.\n",
    "- **NNUE in Stockfish**: In August 2020, Stockfish 12 integrated the Efficiently Updatable Neural Network (NNUE), marking a significant evolution in chess engine evaluation methods. By 2021, leading chess engines, including Komodo Dragon, adopted NNUE for enhanced positional understanding without the need for GPU resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Approach in Sturddle\n",
    "- **Neural Network (NN) Evaluation**: Sturddle uses a neural network for position evaluation when the material balance is within a specific margin. This method is effective for games with complex positional nuances.\n",
    "- **Material Delta Evaluation**: For positions with a material imbalance exceeding a defined threshold, Sturddle employs a simpler material delta evaluation. This fast approach is suitable for positions where the material difference significantly influences the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual evaluation strategy in Sturddle optimizes efficiency and effectiveness across various chess positions, blending nuanced neural network analysis with straightforward material evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Network Integration\n",
    "In its first iteration, Sturddle utilized the [NNUE Probe Library](https://github.com/dshawul/nnue-probe), leveraging NNUE models developed by the Stockfish Community. This version achieved an ELO rating of around 3070, as evaluated by the Computer Chess Rating Lists (CCRL).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second version of Sturddle is enhanced with a neural network designed from the ground up and trained via a custom Tensorflow script. This version has shown improved performance in initial tests, though it has not yet been submitted for formal evaluation by the CCRL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Focus\n",
    "Sturddle is more than just a chess engine; it is a platform for experimenting with and understanding AI. The project uses chess as a practical tool to investigate both historical and modern approaches in AI, serving as a valuable learning and research medium in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Network Training and Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Data Sources\n",
    "The neural network is trained on a diverse dataset encompassing games from Lichess, Leela Chess Zero, and games played by my own engine. Incorporating data from the engine itself serves as a form of reinforced learning, enhancing the adaptability and depth of the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Environment and Dataset\n",
    "Training is conducted on a Linux machine equipped with an RTX 3090 graphics card. The datasets used are:\n",
    "- A smaller dataset consisting of 6.5 billion moves.\n",
    "- A larger dataset, currently at 14.2 billion moves, with a target of reaching 20 billion by the end of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is stored in HD5 file format, optimizing the storage and retrieval processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Representation\n",
    "The engine uses occupancy bitmaps for chess board representation, detailing 6 piece types for each color across 64 squares. This design facilitates the conversion of these bitmaps into neural network input features. The input layer comprises:\n",
    "- 768 features for the occupancy bitmaps.\n",
    "- 1 feature for the side to move.\n",
    "- 128 additional features, derived by overparameterizing the occupancy masks for black and white, totaling 769 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function and Data Filtering\n",
    "- **Huber Loss Variation**: The training of the neural network utilizes a variation of the Huber loss function. This choice is due to its robustness in handling outliers, which is particularly useful in the diverse set of chess positions and evaluations.\n",
    "- **Evaluation Range Filtering**: The training script includes a feature to filter out evaluations (Y values) beyond a certain range. By default, only evaluations within the range of [-15000, 15000] centipawns are used. This filtering helps focus the training on more typical game scenarios and avoids extreme cases that are less relevant for general gameplay\n",
    "\n",
    "Details on the Loss Function design can be found [here](https://github.com/cristivlas/sturddle-2/blob/master/softclip.ipynb)."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Experimentation with Training Parameters\n",
    "- **Filter and Delta Values**: Ongoing experiments are being conducted to find optimal values for both the filter threshold and the delta parameter of the Huber loss function. For instance, one effective version of the network was trained with a delta of 3.0 and a filter threshold of 1500 centipawns.\n",
    "- **Current Training Runs**: Training runs with varying filter and delta values are underway to evaluate their impact on the network's performance and learning efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Fine-Tuning\n",
    "- **Selective Freezing of Network Layers**: Modifications have been made to the training script to allow parts of the neural network to be \"frozen.\" This technique enables fine-tuning of the network, where specific layers are fixed, and learning is focused on other parts of the network. This approach is beneficial for refining the network's performance based on previous learning while adapting to new data or strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "These enhancements and experiments reflect a continuous effort to optimize the neural network's performance for chess analysis and decision-making. The ongoing training and adjustments are aimed at achieving a balance between accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference\n",
    "In line with techniques used in NNUE (Neural Networks Updated Efficiently), our inference process takes advantage of the binary nature of input features (0 or 1) and the minimal changes introduced by chess moves. This allows for the incremental computation of the first layer of the neural network, rather than full dot products for each move. We maintain a stack of states during the alpha-beta graph search, with individual stacks for each core to avoid race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CPU-Only Inference for Wide Compatibility\n",
    "Inference is implemented in C++ for CPU-only execution, ensuring compatibility with low-end Android devices. The implementation makes use of:\n",
    "- Agner Fog's VCL2 ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vectorclass/version2))\n",
    "- simde ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde))\n",
    "- Custom NEON code to optimize performance with `__ARM_FEATURE_FP16_VECTOR_ARITHMETIC` where available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Machine Learning Tools and Methodologies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Tools\n",
    "Several machine learning tools are instrumental in the development of the engine:\n",
    "- A script based on Nevergrad is used for optimizing engine parameters. [Lakas](https://github.com/fsmosca/Lakas)\n",
    "- A Bayesian tuner is employed for fine-tuning one or two-dimensional parameters. [Chess Tuning Tools Documentation](https://chess-tuning-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### UCI Integration and Tuning Mode\n",
    "When compiled in tuning mode, the engine exposes its internal parameters to the Universal Chess Interface (UCI). In the release mode, these parameters are set as compile-time constants. This dual-mode functionality allows for extensive testing and optimization during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection for Reinforced Learning\n",
    "During tuning runs, there is an option to enable data collection. Evaluations from the neural network, particularly from the winning perspective, are collected and fed back into the training process. This approach reinforces the learning capabilities of the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Methodology and Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimentation with Perspective-Based Training\n",
    "We have experimented with training the neural network on values from the perspective of the side-to-move, yielding reasonable results. The current architecture in development, however, is trained on ground truth evaluations from the white player's perspective. These evaluations are switched post-inference at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Architecture\n",
    "The neural network features two distinct paths:\n",
    "- The main path includes an averaging pooling layer, which aids in reducing dimensionality and smoothing outliers.\n",
    "- A secondary path focuses on features representing pawns and kings. These pieces encapsulate implicit information about game phases. After processing through two layers, the results are multiplied with the outputs from the first layer of the main network path.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Model Architecture](model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights from the training process in the Sturddle chess engine can be exported and imported in two ways. Firstly, at compile time, the training script provides an option to export weights as C++ code snippets, suitable for modern compilers. Secondly, at runtime, weights can be exported as JSON, and the engine includes a custom UCI command for importing them. This flexibility enables efficient weight handling during engine development and deployment."
